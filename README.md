This project focuses on developing an AI-powered plant disease detection system using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on an image dataset from Kaggle, containing various plant leaf images labeled with different disease types. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system can accurately classify plant diseases, assisting farmers and agricultural experts in early diagnosis and treatment. The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from Kaggle's "New Plant Diseases Dataset", ensuring a diverse and well-labeled collection of images for effective model performance.
